I'm a DevOps engineer based in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. You can get in touch with me through the links at the bottom of this page. You can also find me lurking on Freenode as `t_pageflt`.

In my spare time I enjoy tinkering with security, low-level programming, operating systems and open-source software.
