I'm a Security Engineer based in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. You can get in touch with me through the links at the bottom of this page.

In my spare time I enjoy tinkering with security, low-level programming, operating systems and open-source software.

This site is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank"} and it's based on a stripped-down version of [Tale](https://github.com/chesterhow/tale){:target="_blank"} theme.
